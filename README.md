# AHK_Strega

This is a personal project which I'd uploaded in GitHub just for the sakes of simplifying the efforts to make changes across devices during my free time

The Project as currently it is, it's just a Concept development in the AHK Script environment.

1. Files Sorter (General)
> Will check for specifics folders(In a list like array) and then perform some action.
The script should additionally be able to judge the file's name and appropriately deal with it based on the file's name. It will move it at 'X' Location if it complies with 'Y' Conditions.

This was inspired by my need to have to deal with university's files without the mind numbing of individually sorting and move the files. I would just rename it, and then let it be sorted instantly or however I wanted just by editing the file's name
