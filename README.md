# AHK_Strega

This is a personal project which I'd uploaded in GitHub just for the sakes of simplifying the efforts to make changes across devices during my free time

The Project as currently it is, it's just a Concept development in the AHK Script environment.

## The 2 main concepts to develop are:
1. Music Files Sorter.
>  It will create folders which can be used as a form of Playlist. 	- It will create folders which can be used as a sort of Playlist. A Folder Playlist can then be moved to an USB, and you would still have a folder for your own mixes that you want to hear only when you're, let's say at home in front of your computer. Or another folder to share specifically with your friends and leave out your NikoNiko hidden at your home.

The next step is to edit the file's metadata because all Chads loves to leave credits where it's due to. Or because they appreciate information.

2. Files Sorter (General)
> Will check for specifics folders(In a list like array) and then perform some action.
The script should additionally be able to judge the file's name and appropriately deal with it based on the file's name. It will move it at 'X' Location if it complies with 'Y' Conditions.

This was inspired by my need to have to deal with universitie's files without the mind numbing of individually sorting and move the files. I would just rename it, and then let it be sorted instantly or however I wanted just by editing the file's name
